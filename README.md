# Floating_Point_Multiplier
Designed and implemented a pipelined floating-point multiplier in Verilog HDL.  Utilized advanced optimization techniques like pipelining, custom hardware units (e.g., carry-lookahead adder), and rounding logic for improved performance. Ensured robust handling of special cases (NaN, infinity, denormalized numbers).
